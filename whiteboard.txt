Make a console application that takes a word and returns the Scrabble score for that word. 
Make sure to start with your specs, and that you include a README for this project and 
create a Git repository for it. Here are the values of letters in Scrabble:

A, E, I, O, U, L, N, R, S, T       1
D, G                               2
B, C, M, P                         3
F, H, V, W, Y                      4
K                                  5
J, X                               8
Q, Z                               10


1) Program needs to take in a word from user
2) Program needs to split that word into single characters
3) Program needs a constructor that will include the users score and word
4) project needs a larger method that includes smaller methods:
    OnePointLetterCheck() - return score
    onePtLetter = A, E, I, O, U, L, N, R, S, T
      foreach (string onePtLetter in UserWordrray)
      {
        score +1
      }
    TwoPointLetterCheck() - return score
    ThreePointLetterCheck() - return score
    ...
    ...
    ...
    ...
    AddScore() - return total score
5) Program will output user's word and score value
